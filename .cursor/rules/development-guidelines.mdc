# Development Guidelines

Follow these principles when implementing features or making changes:

## Performance

- **Always take performance into consideration** when writing or modifying code
- If there is risk of a performance regression, **note it explicitly** and verify before implementing
- Check performance implications of: database queries, API calls, loops, caching strategies, and resource allocation

## Test Coverage

- **Always aim for maximum test coverage** for new and modified code
- Add unit tests for new functions and logic
- Add integration tests where appropriate for workflows and API endpoints
- Ensure edge cases and error paths are covered

## Documentation

- **Always update documentation** as relevant when making changes
- Update README, API docs, inline comments, and configuration documentation
- Keep docs in sync with code changes—outdated docs are worse than no docs

## Backend Configuration & UI

- If it makes sense to **expose a backend configuration as a UI element**, consider it
- When design options exist for exposing configuration, **ask for input** on the preferred approach before implementing
