# Consistency Review

When implementing features or making changes, **always review code and architecture choices for consistency** with the application.

## Code & Architecture Consistency

- **Evaluate new code** against existing patterns, conventions, and structure in the codebase
- **Align architectural decisions** with established application design—avoid introducing divergent patterns without justification
- **Maintain consistency** in: naming, module organization, data flow, error handling, and API design

## Leverage Repository Documentation

- **Consult code and architecture documents** in the repository before implementing significant changes
- Reference relevant docs in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/code-review.md`, `docs/performance.md`, `docs/errors.md`) and other architecture/design documentation
- When documentation exists for a domain or feature, **follow it** unless there is a documented reason to deviate
- If you discover inconsistencies between code and documentation, **flag them** and resolve as part of the change
