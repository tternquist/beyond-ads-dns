# Maximum performance tuning overrides.
# Extends default config with larger caches and higher throughput settings.
#
# Key optimizations:
#   - L0 cache: 100K entries (vs 10K default) for more hit rate
#   - Refresh: higher max_inflight, larger max_batch_size for sweep
#   - TTLs: longer min/max for fewer upstream queries
#   - Query store: larger batch for less frequent flushes
