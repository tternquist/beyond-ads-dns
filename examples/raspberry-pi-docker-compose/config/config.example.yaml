# Optional overrides for Raspberry Pi deployment.
# Copy to config.yaml and edit as needed.
#
# For minimal disk writes, keep request_log disabled (default).
#
# Recommended: cap ClickHouse table size so it never exceeds tmpfs (256MB).
# Oldest partitions are dropped when over limit. The compose sets QUERY_STORE_MAX_SIZE_MB=200 by default.
# To override via config (alternative to env var):
# query_store:
#   max_size_mb: 200
#   retention_days: 2   # Shorter retention helps fit in RAM
#
# blocklists:
#   allowlist: [example.com]
#   denylist: []
